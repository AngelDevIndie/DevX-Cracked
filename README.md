# DevX-Cracked

# 11.09 alrdy WIP!

This is a cracked version of the full Game Recovery license of DevX. The one who cracked it has asked me not to share their name. The purpose of going public with it is so that the modding community can expand on the knowledge that's been gained, by sharing their own discoveries made with it (I'm still discovering new tricks with it).

Jasmur and I have managed to do some very interesting things as far as OBB and Bundle modding goes on mobile (thus bypassing integrity checks, and allowing for Google sign in without root) To name a few things possible:

-Universal WallHack

-Universal Chams 

-AimBot (You read that correctly, I will explain in the guide). 

-Silent Aim 

-AntiCheat Bypasses (by forcing some AC prefabs to not be Active) 

-Unlocking Developer/Debug/GameTest/Cheat menus (by forcing these prefabs to be Active lol) 

-No Clip & Deletion of obstacles 

-God Mode 

-Unlimited Ammo 

-Instant Reload 

-Flying 

-Speed

Why use DevX?
-------------
- Restore C# Source (as much as it's able) And freely inspect it within
- Restore Unity Project of game, and explore the scenes freely, with useful information such as Transform, Rotation, Scale, and More (In some cases you can even go as - - far as building the game (assuming you have the patience to fix a whole lot of broken scripts)
- Generate ASM (For inspecting within the tool)
- Allows for modification and repacking of OBB (found in Android/Obb/PackageName/) and Asset Bundles (Android/Data/(PackageName)/(UsuallyFoundWithinHere)%
- Modding the Transform/Scale/Rotation/Texture/Mesh of ANY GameObject in the game lets your imagination run wild. (you can create custom maps)
- Access and modify MonoBehavior scripts (Extremely useful, see guide)
- Good extension to have for modding (Can view/modify all components used by a GameObject, and see which scripts are attached/used
- Basically having almost as much power as a developer
- There's a whole lot more that I'm too lazy to list, but I'll let your curious mind explore ;)

-------------
